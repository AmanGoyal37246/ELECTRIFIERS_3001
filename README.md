# ELECTRIFIERS_3001
Repository for create-a-thon challenge

Steps:
1) Capturing faces from the training video using haarcascode_frontalface_default.xml
2) Extracting images to a specific folder as a dataset for further analysis.
3) Classifying images as criminals
4) Using SSIM technique to compare images from new video and classify them as criminals/non-criminals

Training video used: tbbt.mp4
dataset generated after training video: folder (Dataset generated after face extraction)
Testing dataset used: testing video.mp4

How to run:
1) Open Dataset_generation_using _face_extraction in google collab
2) Run all the cells one by one
